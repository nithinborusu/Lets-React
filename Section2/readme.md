# Section1 - Building react app with parcel 
## Igniting the App

# In this section i learned about the following topics in both theory and code

## Theory :

- What is `npm`?
- What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
- Why is `.parcel-cache`?
- What is `npx`?
- What is difference between `dependencies vs devDependencies`?
- What is Tree Shaking?
- What is Hot Module Replacement?
- List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.
- What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
- What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files?
- Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
- What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
- What is the `dist` folder?
- What is `browserlists`? and Read about different bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel
- Read about: `^-caret` and `~-tilde`
- React about Script types in html(MDN Docs)

## Coding :

In your existing project

- initialized `npm` into your repo
- installed  `react and `react-dom`
- removed CDN links of react
- installed parcel
- ignited my app with `parcel`
- added script for "start" and "build" with parcel commands
- added `.gitignore` file
- added  `browserlists`
- built a production version of your code using `parcel build`

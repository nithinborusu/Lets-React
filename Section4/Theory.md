## Q: Is `JSX` mandatory for React?

A: `JSX` is an Extension Syntax that allows writing HTML and Javascript together easily in React and is used to create React elements. These elements are then rendered to the React DOM. Each JSX element is just to make use of React easy and for calling React.createElement(component, props, …children) with less work. So, anything that is done with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript. So `JSX` is not mandatory but is used for writing better and clean code instead of writing code using `React.CreateElement`.

## Q: Is `ES6` mandatory for React?

A: `ES6` is not mandatory for `React` but is highly recommendable. The latest projects created on React rely a lot on ES6. React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like: Classes, Arrow Functions, Variables(let, const).
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015.

## Q: How can I write `comments` in JSX?

A: JSX comments are written as follows:
 - `{/* */}` - for single or multiline comments
#### Example

```
{/* A JSX comment */}
{/*
  Multi
  line
  JSX
  comment
*/}
```
## Q: What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?

A: `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
`<></>` is the shorthand tag for `React.Fragment`. The only difference between them is that the shorthand version does not support the key attribute.

#### Example

```
return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </React.Fragment>
    );

return (
        <>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </>
    );
```

## Q: What is `Reconciliation` in React?
A: Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the UI to reflect changes in the component state. The reconciliation algorithm is the set of rules that React uses to determine how to update the UI in the most efficient way possible. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI.

## Q: What is `React Fiber`?

A: React Fiber is a concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster, smoother and smarter.
The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of React’s reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React.
Because Fiber is asynchronous, React can:

- Pause, resume, and restart rendering work on components as new updates come in
- Reuse previously completed work and even abort it if not needed
- Split work into chunks and prioritize tasks based on importance


## Q: Why do we need `keys` in React?

A: A `key` is a special attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are unique Identifier used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.
Keys should be given to the elements within the array to give the elements a stable identity.

#### Example

```
<li key={0}>1</li>
<li key={1}>2</li>
<li key={2}>3</li>
```

## Q: Can we use `index as keys` in React?

A: Yes, we can use the indexes in places of keys, but it is not considered as a good practice to use them. Keys are taken from each object which is being rendered. There might be a possibility that if we modify the incomming data react may reander them in unusual order.

## Q: What is `props in React`? Ways to.

A: props stands for properties. Props are arguments passed into React components. props are used in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). They are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic.

#### Example

```
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Tool name="Nithin" tool="Figma"/> // name and tool are props
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Q: What is `Config Driven UI`?

A: `Config Driven UI`  are based on the configuarions of the data application receives. It is rather a good practice to use config driven UIs to make application for dynamic.
